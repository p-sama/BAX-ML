The assignment is based on the wine quality dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
Link to the data - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data.
The data contains entries for a wine with the chemical composition as columns and the quality marked in numbers.
Higher the quality value, better the wine quality (Generally, >6.5 is considered good qualtiy wine).
The code builds a logistic model to predit the quality of a wine given the chemical composition.
