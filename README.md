# Prep_Assignment Folder -
1. Contains the assignment based on the wine quality dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The Kaggle exercise was classification, but I have used logistic regression modeling for this assignment.
2. Link to the data - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data
3. The data contains entries for different wines with the chemical composition as columns and the quality marked in numbers
4. Higher the quality value, better the wine quality (Generally, >6.5 is considered good qualtiy wine)
